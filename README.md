# WeatherToday

A Django weather app that displays temperature, conditions, and humidity for any city in the world inputted by the user. A user may add and delete as many cities as they wish, given that the city name is valid, and duplicate cities cannot added. 

### Note:
This app is not fully deployed due to certain issues that I am currently troubleshooting.
